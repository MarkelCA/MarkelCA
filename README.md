### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Markel. I love software, learning, and sharing. 

I'm into backend and systems engineering, performance, memory and high-intensive applications. However, I touch a lot of different stuff because I'm curious, I simply like to try and make sense out of things.

I'm still just getting started, but my goal it's to become a great software engineer and build amazing technology.

You can find my personal blog in [medium](https://medium.com/@markelca).
